# How DAO Crowdfunding Works

## Campaign Proposal: 

Individuals submit funding requests (e.g., disaster relief, education). Campaigns are created with a title, description, funding goal, deadline, and an initial amount of funds raised. Campaign creators can withdraw funds only after reaching a majority vote from DAO members.

## Contributions:
Anyone can contribute ETH to a campaign as long as it hasnâ€™t ended. Contributions are tracked.

## DAO Voting on Withdrawals:
After a campaign ends, DAO members can vote on whether the campaign creator should be allowed to withdraw the raised funds. A campaign can only proceed to withdrawal if more than half of the DAO members vote in favor.

## Fund Distribution:
The campaign creator can withdraw funds once the voting requirement is met, and the funds will be transferred to their address. The withdrawal is marked as completed, and the amount is reset to 0.
